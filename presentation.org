* How do we verify software?
** Unit Testing
1.
2.
# Let's illustrate this problem by the simplest example
*** Introduce the integratonTestClass

** Static & Dynamic Analysis
*** Fuzzing
# 2-3 slides for explanation

* Combining ...
# fuzzing hasn't been used for this purpose before
** We need something that will
# independent functionalities
# TODO see how much time is left for explanations
1. store pointers to member functions
   # we will need different type signatures, managing arguments, etc
2. generate sequences of calls
   # this is a fuzz related problem.
3. observe coverage
   # introduce SanitizerCoverage library here
4. compare the results and determine most efficient

* Demo
** Installation
only build and test
mention unit tests
# ? how much in detail about this
** Set up the main file
# metnion that users are developers and editing is expected
** Run and discuss results
